### Content Based Image Retrieval with a VP-Tree of image hashes 

## A Vantage-Point Tree is a data structure that reduces search time to O(log n).
## It takes a position and splits the data points into near/far from the point,
## and it does this recursively splitting into smaller sets
## so that neighbors have smaller distances.
