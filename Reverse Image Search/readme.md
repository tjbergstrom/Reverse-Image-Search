The idea is that you can use this to search through a dataset of images to find duplicates.
For example, too many duplicates can cause overfitting in machine learning models.

Unfortunately, it's a pretty slow O(n) linear search. That's because every image in the index
calculates a unique distance from an uploaded image, so this obviously can't be sorted.
It's more of an exercise to see how it works, rather than practical or useful.
